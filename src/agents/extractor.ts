CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE:
- Your final response must be ONLY a JSON object
- NO text before the JSON (no "Here is", "Perfect!", etc.)
- NO text after the JSON
- NO explanations or commentary
- Start directly with { and end with }

Your task:
1. Use mcp__craft__blocks_get to read Craft documents
2. Extract agent instructions from the content
3. Return ONLY the JSON object - nothing else`;

    const prompt = `Extract agent definition from Craft document ID "${documentId}" (agent: "${agentName}").

CRITICAL ID DISTINCTION:
- Document ID: "${documentId}" - This is the ID of the agent's document. Use this when referring to "the document" or "this document".
- Block IDs: The nested blocks inside the document have their own IDs (e.g., for Instructions subpage). Use these only when referring to specific blocks within the document.
- NEVER use a block ID when you mean the document ID. They are different!

=== INCREMENTAL LOADING STRATEGY ===

Use a conservative, step-by-step approach to minimize unnecessary data loading:

STEP 1: Get Document Outline (REQUIRED)
- Call mcp__craft__blocks_get with id="${documentId}" and maxDepth=1
- This gives you the top-level structure: document title and immediate children
- Examine the block titles/content to identify:
  * Instructions section (PRIORITY) - Look for pages named "Instructions", "AI Instructions",
    "Agent Instructions", "System Prompt", "Prompt", "Behavior", "Persona", or similar
  * If no such section exists, the document root content IS the instructions
  * "MCP Servers" or similar sections (may contain server configs)
  * Code blocks at the top level (may contain inline configs)
  * Any section names suggesting APIs, integrations, or configurations

STEP 2: Load Instructions Content (REQUIRED)
There are two valid document structures:

A) Document has an Instructions-like subpage:
   Look for a root-level page with a name that suggests it contains agent instructions:
   - Exact matches: "Instructions", "AI Instructions", "Agent Instructions"
   - Similar names: "System Prompt", "Prompt", "Behavior", "Persona", "Config"
   - Any page that contextually appears to define how the agent should behave

   If found:
   - Note that block's ID (different from ${documentId})
   - Call mcp__craft__blocks_get with id="[instructions_block_id]" and maxDepth=2
   - Use that block ID as instructionsBlockId

B) Document root IS the instructions (no Instructions-like subpage):
   - The content from Step 1 IS the instructions
   - Leave instructionsBlockId empty/null (there is no dedicated instructions block)
   - This is a valid structure, NOT an error

Both structures are equally valid. Do NOT add info messages about missing Instructions sections.

STEP 3: Selectively Load Additional Sections (CONDITIONAL)
Only load additional sections if Step 1 revealed potentially relevant content:

a) MCP Server Sections:
   - If you see a section like "MCP Servers", "Servers", "Integrations", "Configuration":
     * Load that specific block with maxDepth=1 or maxDepth=2
   - If top-level code blocks exist, they may already contain server configs from Step 1

b) API Documentation Sections:
   - If you see sections like "APIs", "REST APIs", "Endpoints", "Integration Guide":
     * Load that specific block with maxDepth=2
   - Look for sections containing words: curl, fetch, API, endpoint, request

c) Code Blocks Discovery:
   - If you saw code blocks in Step 1 outline but couldn't read their content:
     * Load those specific blocks to see if they contain MCP or API configs

STEP 4: Final Pass (ONLY IF NEEDED)
- If after Steps 1-3 you still haven't found expected content:
  * You may load the full document with maxDepth=3 as a fallback
  * But ONLY do this if the incremental approach failed to find Instructions
- Most documents should NOT need this step

=== DECISION GUIDELINES ===

DO load a section if:
- It's named "Instructions" (always load this)
- It contains the word "MCP", "Server", "API", "Config", "Integration"
- It's a code block that might contain configuration
- The outline suggests it has relevant content

DO NOT load a section if:
- It's clearly unrelated (e.g., "Meeting Notes", "Archive", "Drafts")
- It's a large section with no indication of agent-relevant content
- You already have the information you need

=== EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS ===

From the loaded content, extract:

1. INSTRUCTIONS (Primary Goal)
Extract the EXACT original instructions without modification. Critical rules:
- Do NOT prepend any identity context - that is added at runtime
- Do NOT add document IDs or agent names to the instructions
- Preserve the EXACT wording, structure, and formatting from the original document
- Fix only obvious formatting issues (e.g., broken markdown)
- Keep human-friendly references like "this document", "this page", "the Instructions section"

API KEY/AUTHENTICATION INSTRUCTIONS - REMOVE THESE:
The system automatically collects API keys during agent setup and injects them into requests.
REMOVE any instructions about API key acquisition or setup from the extracted instructions, including:
- "Get your API key from..."
- "You'll need to provide an API key..."
- "Sign up at [service] to get an API key"
- "Set your API key in the environment..."
- "The user will provide the API key..."
- Any instructions telling the user OR agent how to obtain/configure API credentials
These are setup concerns, not agent behavior. The extracted instructions should focus on WHAT the agent does, not HOW to authenticate.

2. MCP SERVER CONFIGURATIONS
- Look for MCP server configurations in code blocks (YAML, JSON, or plain URLs)
- ONLY include servers with HTTP/HTTPS URLs in the mcpServers array
- if authentication type (OAuth, API token, or public) is not specified or implied by the MCP configuration, assume the server is authenticated with OAuth.
- UNSUPPORTED server types (do NOT include in mcpServers):
  * npx commands (e.g., "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem")
  * command/args configs (e.g., { "command": "npx", "args": [...] })
  * stdio transports
  * Any server config without an http:// or https:// URL

3. REST API DOCUMENTATION EXTRACTION
Look for REST API configurations and extract COMPREHENSIVE documentation.
These are NOT MCP servers, but regular HTTP APIs that will become flexible tools.

IMPORTANT: Each API will become ONE tool that accepts { path, method, params }.
Authentication is FULLY AUTOMATIC:
- API keys are collected from the user during agent setup (not at runtime)
- The system injects authentication into every request automatically
- The agent NEVER sees, handles, or needs to know about API keys
- You just need to identify WHAT TYPE of auth the API uses so we can inject it correctly

Detect APIs from:
- curl examples (e.g., curl -X POST https://api.example.com/search -H "x-api-key: KEY" -d '{"query": "test"}')
- fetch() calls or axios requests
- Inline API documentation describing endpoints
- Links to API documentation pages

For each API found, extract:
- name: Short identifier (e.g., "exa", "openai") - derive from hostname if not explicit
- baseUrl: Base URL without path (e.g., "https://api.exa.ai")
- auth: Authentication config - identify the TYPE so the system can inject credentials:
  SUPPORTED AUTH TYPES (pick one):
  - type: "none" - No authentication required (public API, free tier, etc.)
    No additional fields needed. The credential prompt will be skipped entirely.
  - type: "header" - Custom header auth (e.g., -H "x-api-key: KEY")
    Set headerName to the header name (e.g., "x-api-key", "X-API-Key")
  - type: "bearer" - Authorization header auth (e.g., -H "Authorization: Bearer KEY")
    Set authScheme if NOT "Bearer" (e.g., "Token", "ApiKey", "Key")
    Default authScheme is "Bearer" if not specified
  - type: "query" - Query parameter auth (e.g., ?api_key=KEY or ?key=KEY)
    Set queryParam to the parameter name (e.g., "api_key", "key", "token")
  - type: "basic" - HTTP Basic Authentication (username:password)
    User will be prompted for two credentials separately.

  CREDENTIAL LABELS (extract from document context):
  - credentialLabel: What the document calls the first/main credential
    Examples: "API Key", "Access Token", "Client ID", "App Key"
    For basic auth, this is what they call the username-equivalent (e.g., "API Key")
  - secretLabel: For basic auth only - what they call the password-equivalent
    Examples: "Secret Key", "API Secret", "Client Secret"

  Look for phrases like "API_KEY:SECRET_KEY", "client_id:client_secret", etc. to determine labels.

  How to determine auth type (CHECK IN THIS ORDER):
  1. Look at curl examples or code snippets FIRST - they are the most reliable source
  2. If you see -H "Authorization: Bearer xxx" → use "bearer"
  3. If you see -H "Authorization: Token xxx" → use "bearer" with authScheme: "Token"
  4. If you see -H "x-api-key: xxx" or similar custom header → use "header" with headerName
  5. If you see ?api_key=xxx in URL → use "query" with queryParam
  6. If you see curl -u username:password OR -H "Authorization: Basic xxx" → use "basic"
  7. If no auth in examples AND API is described as public/free → use "none"
  8. If unclear but API requires auth → default to "bearer"

  IMPORTANT: Do NOT use "basic" just because the word "basic" appears in the document.
  Only use "basic" if you see ACTUAL HTTP Basic Authentication patterns:
  - curl -u user:pass
  - Authorization: Basic <base64>
  - Explicit mention of "HTTP Basic Authentication" as the auth method
- documentation: COMPREHENSIVE markdown documentation that will be included in the tool description.
  This is CRITICAL - the agent uses this to figure out how to call the API. Include:
  * ALL available endpoints with their paths and HTTP methods
  * Parameter descriptions with types and valid values
  * Example requests showing typical usage (as JSON objects - NO auth headers needed in examples)
  * Response format descriptions if available
  * Rate limits and constraints if mentioned
  * PAGINATION DETAILS ARE CRITICAL - mention any limit/count/numResults params prominently
  * Related endpoint relationships (e.g., "use /contents after /search")

  DO NOT include in documentation:
  * How to get an API key
  * Authentication setup instructions
  * API key headers in examples (auth is injected automatically)

  Format as readable markdown. Example documentation field:
  """
  ## Endpoints

  ### POST /search
  Search the web using neural or keyword search.

  **Parameters:**
  - query (string, required): Search query
  - numResults (int, 1-100, default 10): Number of results. START WITH 5-10 to avoid huge responses.
  - type (string): "neural" for semantic search, "keyword" for exact match
  - category (string, optional): "news", "research paper", "company", "github"

  **Example:** {"query": "AI news", "numResults": 5, "type": "neural"}

  ### POST /contents
  Get full page content for URLs. Use after /search to get full content of relevant results.

  **Parameters:**
  - urls (array of strings, required): URLs to fetch content from
  - text (object, optional): {maxCharacters: 1000} to limit content length

  **Example:** {"urls": ["https://example.com"], "text": {"maxCharacters": 5000}}
  """
- docsUrl: Link to official API documentation if found (optional)

4. INFO MESSAGES
Use the "info" array to communicate important information to the user. You MUST add info messages for:
- Unsupported MCP servers: "MCP server '[name]' uses npx/stdio which is not supported. Only HTTP/HTTPS servers work."
- Empty document (no content at all): "Document has no content."
- Malformed or unparseable MCP configs: "Could not parse MCP server config in code block."
- APIs found: "Found API '[name]'."
- Unsupported automation features (see below): Add info message explaining the limitation
- Any other issues or warnings the user should know about during agent setup

PLATFORM LIMITATIONS - IMPORTANT:
This is an interactive CLI tool. It CANNOT:
- Run automatically or on a schedule (no cron, no background tasks)
- Wake up or trigger itself (no webhooks, no event listeners)
- Run continuously in the background
- Send notifications or alerts proactively
- Set or schedule reminders
- Monitor things over time without user interaction

If the instructions mention ANY of these features, add an info message like:
"Note: '[feature]' requires automation/scheduling which is not supported. This agent only responds when you interact with it."

EXTERNAL SERVICE INTEGRATIONS:
If instructions mention external services (email, Slack, Discord, GitHub, calendar, etc.) that aren't already configured:
- Add info: "To enable [service] integration, add an API config (curl examples or API docs) or MCP server config as a code block in this document."
- Common examples:
  * Email: "To send emails, add an API config for SendGrid, Resend, or similar email service."
  * Slack/Discord: "To post messages, add a Slack/Discord API config or MCP server."
  * GitHub: "To interact with GitHub, add the GitHub API or an MCP server config."
- Do NOT treat missing integrations as concerns - just provide helpful guidance.

Do NOT create concerns or ask questions about these limitations - they cannot be resolved. Just inform the user.

5. CAPABILITIES SUMMARY
Analyze the instructions and extract a list of 3-8 key capabilities this agent has.
Each capability should be a concise phrase (5-15 words) describing what the agent can do.
Examples: "Search the web using Exa neural search", "Create and edit Craft documents", "Write and debug TypeScript code"

6. CONCERNS EXTRACTION - BE SELECTIVE
ONLY extract concerns that are ACTUAL issues that could prevent the agent from working correctly.
DO NOT include trivial, obvious, or non-actionable items. Quality over quantity.

CRITICAL: Concerns must be based on EXISTING content in the document.
- If no Instructions section is found, DO NOT create concerns asking "What should this agent do?"
- If instructions are empty or minimal, DO NOT suggest general capabilities or features
- Suggested answers must NEVER imply new functionality not already in the document
- A concern is about CLARIFYING existing content, not ADDING new content

When document is EMPTY (no content at all):
- Return empty instructions string ""
- Use the info array to notify: "Document has no content."
- Return empty concerns array []

When document has content but no "Instructions" subpage:
- The root content IS the instructions - extract it normally
- Leave instructionsBlockId empty/null (no dedicated instructions block exists)
- This is NOT an error - do not add info messages about it

Types:
1. CONFUSING: Instructions that could genuinely be interpreted multiple ways
2. CONFLICTING: Clear contradictions that need resolution
3. MISSING: Critical info WITHOUT which existing functionality cannot work
4. GENERAL: Significant risks or issues (not minor edge cases)

For each concern, include:
- type: One of the four types above
- description: Concise explanation of the actual issue
- context: The relevant text from instructions (if applicable)
- suggestedQuestion: A clear question to ask the user
- suggestedAnswers: Array of 2-4 MEANINGFUL pre-defined answers (MAX 4, user can always type custom)
  Examples:
  - For "Which API version?" → ["v1 (stable)", "v2 (latest features)", "Both with fallback"]
  - For "When to confirm deletions?" → ["Always", "Only for important items", "Never"]
  Skip suggestedAnswers if no logical options exist (open-ended questions).
  IMPORTANT: Maximum 4 suggested answers. The UI always shows a "Custom" option for free-form input.

If instructions are clear and complete, return empty concerns array []. Do NOT invent concerns.

REMEMBER: "${documentId}" is the DOCUMENT ID. The instructionsBlockId should be:
- The block ID of the Instructions subpage (if one exists), OR
- Empty/null (if the root content IS the instructions - there is no separate block)

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "instructions": "[EXACT instruction content from document - no identity prefix added]",
  "instructionsBlockId": "[block ID of Instructions subpage, OR empty if instructions are at document root]",
  "mcpServers": [{ "name": "myserver", "url": "https://example.com/mcp", "requiresAuth": false }],

    "suggestedAnswers": ["Always use neural search", "Use keyword for exact phrases, neural otherwise", "Ask user each time"]
  }]
}

Rules:
- mcpServers: Empty array [] if no HTTP/HTTPS MCP servers found
- apis: Empty array [] if no REST APIs found. Include APIs even if only one endpoint is detected.
- info: Empty array [] if nothing to report. MUST contain messages for any issues, warnings, or important information.

- concerns: Empty array [] if instructions are clear and complete. Do NOT invent concerns.
- instructions: Empty string "" if document is empty or not found`;
