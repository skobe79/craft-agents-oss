Your task:
1. Use mcp__craft__blocks_get to read Craft documents
2. Extract agent instructions from the content
3. Return ONLY a JSON object - no text before or after

CRITICAL: Your final message must be ONLY valid JSON. No "Perfect!", no explanations, no markdown.
Just the raw JSON object starting with { and ending with }.`;

    const prompt = `Extract agent definition from Craft document ID "${documentId}" (agent: "${agentName}").

CRITICAL ID DISTINCTION:
- Document ID: "${documentId}" - This is the ID of the agent's document. Use this when referring to "the document" or "this document".
- Block IDs: The nested blocks inside the document have their own IDs (e.g., for Instructions subpage). Use these only when referring to specific blocks within the document.
- NEVER use a block ID when you mean the document ID. They are different!

=== INCREMENTAL LOADING STRATEGY ===

Use a conservative, step-by-step approach to minimize unnecessary data loading:

STEP 1: Get Document Outline (REQUIRED)
- Call mcp__craft__blocks_get with id="${documentId}" and maxDepth=1
- This gives you the top-level structure: document title and immediate children
- Examine the block titles/content to identify:
  * "Instructions" section (PRIORITY - this contains the agent behavior)
  * "MCP Servers" or similar sections (may contain server configs)
  * Code blocks at the top level (may contain inline configs)
  * Any section names suggesting APIs, integrations, or configurations

STEP 2: Load Instructions Content (REQUIRED if found)
- If you found an "Instructions" block in Step 1:
  * Note its block ID (this will be different from ${documentId})
  * Call mcp__craft__blocks_get with id="[instructions_block_id]" and maxDepth=2
  * This loads the full instructions content including nested subpages
- If NO "Instructions" section exists:
  * Add info message: "No Instructions section found in document."
  * The document root content may BE the instructions - use what you loaded in Step 1

STEP 3: Selectively Load Additional Sections (CONDITIONAL)
Only load additional sections if Step 1 revealed potentially relevant content:

a) MCP Server Sections:
   - If you see a section like "MCP Servers", "Servers", "Integrations", "Configuration":
     * Load that specific block with maxDepth=1 or maxDepth=2
   - If top-level code blocks exist, they may already contain server configs from Step 1

b) API Documentation Sections:
   - If you see sections like "APIs", "REST APIs", "Endpoints", "Integration Guide":
     * Load that specific block with maxDepth=2
   - Look for sections containing words: curl, fetch, API, endpoint, request

c) Code Blocks Discovery:
   - If you saw code blocks in Step 1 outline but couldn't read their content:
     * Load those specific blocks to see if they contain MCP or API configs

STEP 4: Final Pass (ONLY IF NEEDED)
- If after Steps 1-3 you still haven't found expected content:
  * You may load the full document with maxDepth=3 as a fallback
  * But ONLY do this if the incremental approach failed to find Instructions
- Most documents should NOT need this step

=== DECISION GUIDELINES ===

DO load a section if:
- It's named "Instructions" (always load this)
- It contains the word "MCP", "Server", "API", "Config", "Integration"
- It's a code block that might contain configuration
- The outline suggests it has relevant content

DO NOT load a section if:
- It's clearly unrelated (e.g., "Meeting Notes", "Archive", "Drafts")
- It's a large section with no indication of agent-relevant content
- You already have the information you need

=== EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS ===

From the loaded content, extract:

1. INSTRUCTIONS (Primary Goal)
Extract the EXACT original instructions without modification. Critical rules:
- Do NOT prepend any identity context - that is added at runtime
- Do NOT add document IDs or agent names to the instructions
- Preserve the EXACT wording, structure, and formatting from the original document
- Fix only obvious formatting issues (e.g., broken markdown)
- Keep human-friendly references like "this document", "this page", "the Instructions section"

2. MCP SERVER CONFIGURATIONS
- Look for MCP server configurations in code blocks (YAML, JSON, or plain URLs)
- ONLY include servers with HTTP/HTTPS URLs in the mcpServers array
- UNSUPPORTED server types (do NOT include in mcpServers):
  * npx commands (e.g., "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem")
  * command/args configs (e.g., { "command": "npx", "args": [...] })
  * stdio transports
  * Any server config without an http:// or https:// URL

3. REST API DETECTION
Look for REST API configurations. These are NOT MCP servers, but regular HTTP APIs.
Detect APIs from:
- curl examples (e.g., curl -X POST https://api.example.com/search -H "x-api-key: KEY" -d '{"query": "test"}')
- fetch() calls or axios requests
- Inline API documentation describing endpoints
- Links to API documentation pages

For each API found, extract:
- name: Short identifier (e.g., "exa", "openai") - derive from hostname if not explicit
- baseUrl: Base URL without path (e.g., "https://api.exa.ai")
- auth: Authentication config if detected:
  - type: "header" for -H "x-api-key: ...", "bearer" for -H "Authorization: Bearer ...", "query" for ?api_key=...
  - headerName: The header name for type="header" (e.g., "x-api-key")
  - queryParam: The query param for type="query" (e.g., "api_key")
- endpoints: Array of endpoints, each with:
  - name: Endpoint name derived from path (e.g., "search" from /search)
  - method: HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
  - path: Path relative to baseUrl (e.g., "/search")
  - description: CRITICAL - Write a rich, actionable description that helps Claude use this endpoint effectively:
    * Start with what the endpoint DOES (not just its name)
    * Explain WHEN to use it (use cases, scenarios)
    * List KEY PARAMETERS with their purpose and valid values
    * PAGINATION/LIMITS ARE CRITICAL: Always prominently mention any limit/count/numResults parameters. Large responses can overwhelm context. Recommend conservative defaults (e.g., "numResults: 1-100, default 10, START WITH 5-10 to avoid huge responses")
    * Include any important CONSTRAINTS (rate limits, max results, etc.)
    * Mention RELATED endpoints if relevant
    BAD: "Search the Exa API"
    GOOD: "Search the web using Exa's neural search engine. Use this for finding recent articles, research papers, news, or any web content. Key parameters: query (search string), numResults (1-100, default 10, START WITH 5-10 to avoid huge responses), type ('neural' for semantic search, 'keyword' for exact match), category (optional: 'news', 'research paper', 'company', 'github'). Returns URLs, titles, and snippets. For full page content, follow up with exa_contents using the returned URLs."
  - exampleParams: Example request body extracted from curl -d or request body (as object, not string)

4. INFO MESSAGES
Use the "info" array to communicate important information to the user. You MUST add info messages for:
- Unsupported MCP servers: "MCP server '[name]' uses npx/stdio which is not supported. Only HTTP/HTTPS servers work."
- Missing or empty Instructions section: "No Instructions section found in document."
- Malformed or unparseable MCP configs: "Could not parse MCP server config in code block."
- APIs found: "Found API '[name]' with [N] endpoints."
- Unsupported automation features (see below): Add info message explaining the limitation
- Any other issues or warnings the user should know about during agent setup

PLATFORM LIMITATIONS - IMPORTANT:
This is an interactive CLI tool. It CANNOT:
- Run automatically or on a schedule (no cron, no background tasks)
- Wake up or trigger itself (no webhooks, no event listeners)
- Run continuously in the background
- Send notifications or alerts proactively
- Set or schedule reminders
- Monitor things over time without user interaction

If the instructions mention ANY of these features, add an info message like:
"Note: '[feature]' requires automation/scheduling which is not supported. This agent only responds when you interact with it."

EXTERNAL SERVICE INTEGRATIONS:
If instructions mention external services (email, Slack, Discord, GitHub, calendar, etc.) that aren't already configured:
- Add info: "To enable [service] integration, add an API config (curl examples or API docs) or MCP server config as a code block in this document."
- Common examples:
  * Email: "To send emails, add an API config for SendGrid, Resend, or similar email service."
  * Slack/Discord: "To post messages, add a Slack/Discord API config or MCP server."
  * GitHub: "To interact with GitHub, add the GitHub API or an MCP server config."
- Do NOT treat missing integrations as concerns - just provide helpful guidance.

Do NOT create concerns or ask questions about these limitations - they cannot be resolved. Just inform the user.

5. CAPABILITIES SUMMARY
Analyze the instructions and extract a list of 3-8 key capabilities this agent has.
Each capability should be a concise phrase (5-15 words) describing what the agent can do.
Examples: "Search the web using Exa neural search", "Create and edit Craft documents", "Write and debug TypeScript code"

6. CONCERNS EXTRACTION - BE SELECTIVE
ONLY extract concerns that are ACTUAL issues that could prevent the agent from working correctly.
DO NOT include trivial, obvious, or non-actionable items. Quality over quantity.

Types:
1. CONFUSING: Instructions that could genuinely be interpreted multiple ways
2. CONFLICTING: Clear contradictions that need resolution
3. MISSING: Critical info without which the agent cannot function
4. GENERAL: Significant risks or issues (not minor edge cases)

For each concern, include:
- type: One of the four types above
- description: Concise explanation of the actual issue
- context: The relevant text from instructions (if applicable)
- suggestedQuestion: A clear question to ask the user
- suggestedAnswers: Array of 2-4 MEANINGFUL pre-defined answers (MAX 4, user can always type custom)
  Examples:
  - For "Which API version?" → ["v1 (stable)", "v2 (latest features)", "Both with fallback"]
  - For "When to confirm deletions?" → ["Always", "Only for important items", "Never"]
  Skip suggestedAnswers if no logical options exist (open-ended questions).
  IMPORTANT: Maximum 4 suggested answers. The UI always shows a "Custom" option for free-form input.

If instructions are clear and complete, return empty concerns array []. Do NOT invent concerns.

REMEMBER: "${documentId}" is the DOCUMENT ID. The instructionsBlockId will be a DIFFERENT number (the block ID of the Instructions subpage within the document).

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Return ONLY valid JSON:

  "instructions": "[EXACT instruction content from document - no identity prefix added]",
  "instructionsBlockId": "[block ID of Instructions subpage, NOT ${documentId}]",

    "suggestedAnswers": ["Always use neural search", "Use keyword for exact phrases, neural otherwise", "Ask user each time"]
  }]
}

Rules:
- mcpServers: Empty array [] if no HTTP/HTTPS MCP servers found
- apis: Empty array [] if no REST APIs found. Include APIs even if only one endpoint is detected.
- info: Empty array [] if nothing to report. MUST contain messages for any issues, warnings, or important information.
- capabilities: List of 3-8 key capabilities. Empty array [] if instructions are empty.
- concerns: Empty array [] if instructions are clear and complete. Do NOT invent concerns.
- instructions: Empty string "" if document is empty or not found`;
