Craft Agents is a tool we built so we can work effectively with agents. It enables intuitive multitasking, no-fluff connection to any API or Service, and a more document (vs code) centric workflow - in a beautiful and fluid UI.

It leans on Claude Code through the [Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk) - follow what we found great, and improves areas where we've desired improvements.

It's built with [Agent Native](https://every.to/guides/agent-native) software principles in mind, and is highly customisable out of the box. One of the first of its kind.

Craft Agents is open source under the Apache 2.0 license - so you are free to remix, change **anything.** And that's actually possible. We ourselves are building Craft Agents with Craft Agents only - no code editors - so really, any customisation is just a prompt away.

We built Craft Agents because we wanted a better, more opinionated (and preferably non-CLI way) of working with the most powerful agents in the world. We'll continue to improve it, based on our experiences and intuition.
